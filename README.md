# 🧑‍💻 Terminal-Inspired Portfolio (HTML & CSS Only)

This is my personal portfolio website, designed with a retro **terminal/CLI look**, built **entirely with HTML and CSS** — no JavaScript at all.

> ✨ It’s lightweight, responsive, and designed for a hackathon challenge that restricted the use of JavaScript.

## 📄 Overview

This project is a creative spin on traditional portfolios. It simulates a terminal environment where content is structured into “commands” that reveal different sections. However, since JavaScript is not used, the terminal prompt is static — the commands are just styled links or toggles.

- This is **not** an interactive shell — just styled sections.
- All interactivity is simulated with layout tricks (e.g., anchors, checkboxes, hover).
- Best viewed on modern browsers.
